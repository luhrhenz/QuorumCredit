# QuorumCredit — Proof of Trust (PoT) Microlending

> Trustless microlending powered by your social trust graph — built on Stellar Soroban.

Platform: Stellar Soroban | Language: Rust | License: MIT

## About

QuorumCredit is a decentralized microlending platform that replaces asset collateral with **social collateral**. Inspired by Stellar's **Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA)**, it lets communities vouch for borrowers using staked XLM — no over-collateralization required.

Traditional DeFi lending demands $100 locked up to borrow $50. QuorumCredit flips this: your trust network is your collateral. Vouchers stake XLM to back a borrower. If the loan is repaid, vouchers earn yield. If the borrower defaults, vouchers are slashed.

This platform is designed for developers building on Stellar, fintech teams targeting underserved communities, and anyone exploring social-trust-based credit systems.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/QuorumCredit.git
cd QuorumCredit

# Build the contract
cd QuorumCredit
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

---

## How It Works

### 1. Vouching
Users stake XLM to vouch for a borrower in their network. This stake is transferred into the contract and held as social collateral.

### 2. Loan Eligibility
A borrower becomes eligible once their total vouched stake meets the minimum threshold — no personal collateral needed.

### 3. Repayment & Default

| Outcome | Borrower | Vouchers |
|---|---|---|
| Loan repaid ✅ | Debt cleared, credit history improves | Earn 2% yield on staked XLM |
| Default ❌ | Flagged, future borrowing restricted | 50% of stake slashed |

> **Minimum stake for yield:** A vouch must be at least **50 stroops** to earn non-zero yield.
> At the default 2% rate (200 bps), `stake * 200 / 10_000` truncates to zero for any stake
> under 50 stroops. The contract enforces this minimum in `vouch()` and rejects smaller stakes
> with a clear error rather than silently paying no yield.

### The FBA Inspiration

Stellar nodes select their own **Quorum Slice** — a trusted subset of peers. QuorumCredit mirrors this: each borrower's eligibility is determined by their personal trust graph, not a central credit bureau. You aren't trusting a bank; you're trusting a specific slice of your social network.

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements

- Rust (latest stable)
- Stellar CLI (`stellar-cli`)
- A Stellar account (for deployment)

### 1. Install Rust

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### 2. Install Stellar CLI

```bash
cargo install --locked stellar-cli
stellar --version
```

### 3. Configure Networks

```bash
# Testnet (recommended for development)
stellar network add testnet \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443 \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

# Mainnet
stellar network add mainnet \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.mainnet.stellar.org:443 \
  --network-passphrase "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015"
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (never commit this):

```bash
NETWORK=testnet
DEPLOYER_SECRET_KEY="SB..."   # Your deployer secret key
ADMIN_ADDRESS="GB..."         # Admin account address
TOKEN_CONTRACT="..."          # XLM token contract address
```

> ⚠️ Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`. Never commit secret keys.

---

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cd QuorumCredit
cargo test

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run a specific test
cargo test test_repay_gives_voucher_yield
```

**Test coverage:**

| Test | Verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_vouch_and_loan_disbursed` | Loan record created, funds transferred to borrower |
| `test_repay_gives_voucher_yield` | Voucher receives original stake + 2% yield |
| `test_slash_burns_half_stake` | Voucher loses 50% of stake on default |
| `test_unauthorized_initialize_rejected` | `initialize` panics when called without deployer's signature |

---

## Deployment

### Security: Deployer-Gated Initialization

`initialize` requires the `deployer` address to sign the transaction (`deployer.require_auth()`). This closes the front-running window that exists between contract deployment and initialization:

1. An attacker observing the deployment transaction on-chain cannot call `initialize` first — they cannot forge the deployer's signature.
2. The deployer address is stored in contract storage (`DataKey::Deployer`) for auditability.

**Required deployment sequence — do not deviate:**

```
Step 1: Build the WASM
Step 2: Deploy the contract  ← deployer keypair signs this tx
Step 3: Initialize the contract ← SAME deployer keypair must sign this tx
```

If steps 2 and 3 are not signed by the same keypair, `initialize` will panic and the contract remains uninitialized.

### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
# Build
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Step 1 — Deploy (note the returned CONTRACT_ID)
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/quorum_credit.wasm \
  --network testnet \
  --source $DEPLOYER_SECRET_KEY

# Step 2 — Initialize immediately after deploy, using the SAME source key
# deployer = the account that signed the deploy tx above
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --fn initialize \
  --network testnet \
  --source $DEPLOYER_SECRET_KEY \
  -- \
  --deployer $DEPLOYER_ADDRESS \
  --admin $ADMIN_ADDRESS \
  --token $TOKEN_CONTRACT
```

> The `--source` key for `invoke` must match `--deployer`. Using any other key will cause `require_auth()` to reject the call.

### Deploy to Mainnet

> ⚠️ Production checklist before deploying:
> - [ ] All tests passing
> - [ ] Security audit completed
> - [ ] Testnet deployment verified
> - [ ] Admin keys secured (multisig recommended)
> - [ ] Token contract address confirmed

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/quorum_credit.wasm \
  --network mainnet \
  --source $DEPLOYER_SECRET_KEY
```

### Upgrading the Contract

The `upgrade` function allows the admin (or multisig quorum) to replace the contract WASM after deployment. This is the only path to patching a live vulnerability.

**Upgrade process:**

```
Step 1: Build the new WASM
Step 2: (Recommended) Pause the contract to halt user activity
Step 3: Upload the new WASM and obtain its hash
Step 4: Call upgrade() — requires admin_threshold signatures
Step 5: Unpause the contract
```

```bash
# Step 1 — Build
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Step 2 — Pause (recommended)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID --fn pause --network testnet --source $ADMIN_SECRET_KEY \
  -- --admin_signers '["'$ADMIN_ADDRESS'"]'

# Step 3 — Upload new WASM, capture the returned hash
NEW_WASM_HASH=$(stellar contract install \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/quorum_credit.wasm \
  --network testnet \
  --source $ADMIN_SECRET_KEY)

# Step 4 — Upgrade (admin_threshold admins must sign)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID --fn upgrade --network testnet --source $ADMIN_SECRET_KEY \
  -- \
  --admin_signers '["'$ADMIN_ADDRESS'"]' \
  --new_wasm_hash $NEW_WASM_HASH

# Step 5 — Unpause
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID --fn unpause --network testnet --source $ADMIN_SECRET_KEY \
  -- --admin_signers '["'$ADMIN_ADDRESS'"]'
```

> ⚠️ The `upgrade` call requires `admin_threshold` distinct admin signatures — the same multisig quorum used for all other admin operations. A single compromised key cannot unilaterally upgrade the contract.

## Architecture

```
Borrower
   └── requests loan
         └── Trust Circle (Quorum Slice)
               ├── Voucher A — stakes XLM
               ├── Voucher B — stakes XLM
               └── Voucher C — stakes XLM
                     └── Threshold met → Loan disbursed
                           ├── Repaid → Vouchers earn 2% yield
                           └── Default → 50% of stakes slashed
```

**Key concepts:**

- **Proof of Trust (PoT):** Social collateral replaces asset collateral
- **Quorum Slice:** Your personal set of trusted vouchers, mirroring FBA logic
- **Slash Mechanism:** Vouchers lose 50% of stake on borrower default — aligning incentives
- **Yield on Trust:** Vouchers earn 2% yield for backing reliable borrowers

**Why Stellar?**

- Near-zero transaction fees — critical for microlending viability
- Fast finality (~5s) — practical for real-world loan cycles
- Soroban smart contracts — expressive enough for trust graph logic
- Native XLM — no bridging complexity for staking and disbursement

## 💰 Yield Accounting & Solvency

QuorumCredit uses a **Sustainable Pre-funding Model** for yield distribution. Unlike many DeFi protocols, yield is not "minted" into existence, ensuring no inflationary pressure on the underlying XLM asset.

### Funding Source
Yield is sourced from a dedicated **Yield Reserve** within the contract. For vouchers to earn their 2% yield (`YIELD_BPS = 200`), the contract must be pre-funded by the protocol admin or through external revenue streams (e.g., protocol fees). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The contract must hold sufficient XLM to cover both the principal repayment and the 2% yield. If the reserve is empty, the protocol cannot disburse rewards.

### Solvency & "Hard-Cap" Logic
To ensure the protocol never owes more than it holds, a **Hard-Cap Solvency** model is enforced:
1. **Reserve Check**: The protocol only allows loan disbursement if the contract has sufficient liquidity to cover the loan amount.
2. **Yield Protection**: If the Yield Reserve is depleted, the $2.0\%$ yield accrual effectively halts. In the current implementation, any attempt to pay out yield without sufficient funds will trigger a Soroban `InsufficientFunds` panic, protecting the protocol's integrity.
